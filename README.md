#   Bioinformatics Evaluation of Assembly and Resequencing (BEAR) Pipeline BaseSpace Native App

# Overview
The [Bioinformatics Evaluation of Assembly and Resequencing](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.061499v1) (BEAR) pipeline is for the analysis of   targeted pathogen sequencing using POLAR. The pipeline was packaged into an [Illumina Native App in BaseSpace](https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/docs/content/documentation/native-apps/native-app-overview#BaseSpaceNativeAppEngineOverview). This repository contains all the necessary files needed to create the app.

# Repository Manifest
* Dockerfile : Dockerfile for building Docker image capable of running the BEAR pipeline. 
* requirements.txt: List of modules required for running BEAR pipeline.
* callback.js: Script which specifies which image to download from Docker Hub, file system and command run upon the launch of an app session. 
* input_form.json: JSON file which defines the user input form for the app. 
* app_handler.py: Script which passes user input to BEAR pipeline within a running Docker container in an app session.

# Pipeline Overview
The pipeline takes paired-end sequencing reads and aligns the reads to the reference genome of the targeted pathogen. In the event that the assay includes a control, these data are phased and removed from downstream analyses. The genome-wide coverage data are then used to calculate the breadth of coverage. The breadth of coverage determines whether a sample is positive or negative for the targeted pathogen.
